# 7 CEOS-ARD 

## 7.1 Threshold and Target Requirements from CEOS-ARD Product Family Specification

* 1.12 \- Radiometric Accuracy \- “The metadata includes metrics describing the assessed absolute radiometric uncertainty of the version of the data or product, expressed as absolute radiometric uncertainty relative to appropriate, known reference sites and standards (for example, pseudo-invariant calibration sites, rigorously collected field spectra, PICS, Rayleigh, DCC, etc.)”  
* 2.13 \- Aerosol Optical Depth Parameters \- “To be determined.”  
* 3.1 \- Measurement – “Surface Reflectance measurements are SI traceable.”  
* 3.3  \- Measurement Normalisation  \- “Measurements are normalised for solar and viewing conditions (i.e., nadir view angle and average solar angles). This may include terrain illumination and/or Bi-Directional Reflectance Function (BRDF) correction.”  
* 3.4 \- Directional Atmospheric Scattering \- “Corrections are applied for aerosols and molecular (Rayleigh) scattering.”  
* 3.5 \- Water Vapour Corrections \- “Corrections are applied for water vapor.”  
* 3.6 \- Measurement Normalisation \- “Data is corrected for ozone”
