# 2 Definition : Consistency for two or more surface reflectance measurements 

Surface reflectance measurements from different (satellite)s or sensors can be considered consistent when, for an invariant target and within a predefined range of conditions, they produce comparable results which match within their measurement uncertainties for the same target under predefined conditions.
