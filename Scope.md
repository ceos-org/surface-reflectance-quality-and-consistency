This work addresses sun induced Land Surface Reflectance measurement consistency from two or more satellite sensors within the following range of conditions: 

* Ground Sampling Distance (GSDs) and Instantaneous Field of View (IFOVs) of \~1 to 1000 m  
  * This GSD range is an order of magnitude estimate and somewhat arbitrary given target dependency (surface properties etc.). The exact limits are yet to be confirmed.  
* Wavelength between Ultraviolet to short wave infrared 300-2500 nm (Solar reflective region)  
* Solar elevation angles above approximately 15 degrees  
  * Landsat limits the solar elevation to \~15 degrees since it becomes harder to perform the atmospheric correction. One way to handle this is possibly in uncertainty if we can understand it well enough to quantify it. Low solar elevation angle data is important in the polar regions.  
* (off nadir) Observation angles above approx. 45(?) degrees?  
* outside of topographic or cloud (cast) shadows  
* target reflectance and atmospheric transmission sufficient to achieve an at-sensor radiance exceeding the NER to a level commensurate with required uncertainty.  Signal to Noise considerations â€“ illumination and or sensor sensitivity considerations?
